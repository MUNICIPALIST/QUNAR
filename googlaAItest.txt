Extracted Message Text:
SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g., to dump the database content to the attacker). It exploits a vulnerability in the way an application handles user input, allowing an attacker to interfere with the database queries that the application makes.

Here's a breakdown:

**Core Concept:**

*   **Applications Use SQL:**  Many web applications (and other applications) store and manage data using SQL databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle).  These applications construct SQL queries to retrieve, update, insert, or delete data.
*   **User Input is the Gateway:** Applications often take user input (e.g., from a form, URL parameters, or API calls) and use it to build these SQL queries.
*   **The Vulnerability:** If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate this user input before incorporating it into the SQL query, an attacker can inject their own SQL code.  The database then executes the attacker's code along with the application's intended query.

**How it Works (Example):**

Imagine a simple login form where you enter your username and password.  Behind the scenes, the application might construct a SQL query like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'entered_username' AND password = 'entered_password';
```

Now, suppose an attacker enters the following as their username:

```
' OR '1'='1
```

If the application doesn't properly handle this input, the resulting SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'entered_password';
```

*   `' OR '1'='1'` is a SQL injection.
*   `' OR '1'='1'` always evaluates to `TRUE`.
*   The `WHERE` clause now essentially reads `WHERE username = '' OR TRUE`.  Because `OR TRUE` is always true, it effectively bypasses the username and password check. The query will return *all* rows from the `users` table, and the attacker is logged in (possibly as the first user in the database).

**Types of SQL Injection:**

*   **In-band SQLi:**  The attacker receives the results of their attack directly in the application's response.  This is the most common and easiest to exploit.
    *   **Error-based SQLi:**  The attacker relies on error messages from the database to gain information about the database structure.
    *   **Union-based SQLi:**  The attacker uses the `UNION` SQL operator to combine the results of their malicious query with the results of the original query.
*   **Blind SQLi (Inferential SQLi):**  The attacker doesn't see the results of their attack directly. They must infer information by observing the application's behavior.  This is more difficult to exploit but can be just as damaging.
    *   **Boolean-based Blind SQLi:** The attacker crafts SQL queries that return different results (e.g., true or false) based on the information they are trying to extract. They then observe the application's response to determine the truth value.
    *   **Time-based Blind SQLi:** The attacker crafts SQL queries that cause the database to pause for a specific amount of time. By measuring the time it takes for the application to respond, the attacker can infer information about the database.
*   **Out-of-band SQLi:** The attacker uses features of the database server itself to exfiltrate data, such as sending data to an external server they control.  This is less common as it requires specific database server configurations and often more advanced privileges.

**Impact of SQL Injection:**

The consequences of a successful SQL injection attack can be severe:

*   **Data Breach:**  Sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, financial information, personal details) can be stolen.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  Data can be modified, deleted, or corrupted.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain administrative privileges on the database server.
*   **Denial of Service:** The database server can be overloaded or crashed.
*   **Code Execution:** In some cases, an attacker can even execute arbitrary code on the database server.
*   **Complete System Compromise:**  If the database server is connected to other systems, the attacker may be able to compromise those systems as well.

**Prevention:**

The best way to prevent SQL injection is to avoid dynamic SQL construction using user-supplied input directly. Here are the key techniques:

*   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the *most* effective defense. Parameterized queries treat user input as data, not as SQL code.  The database knows the query structure in advance and treats the parameters as literal values.  This prevents any injected SQL code from being executed.

    ```python
    # Example (Python with a hypothetical database library)
    username = input("Enter username: ")
    password = input("Enter password: ")

    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"
    cursor.execute(query, (username, password))  # The database driver handles the escaping.
    ```

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  While not a complete solution on its own, this can help.
    *   **Whitelisting:**  Only allow known good characters or patterns.  For example, if you expect a phone number, only allow digits and potentially parentheses and hyphens.
    *   **Blacklisting:**  Remove or escape potentially dangerous characters (e.g., quotes, semicolons).  **Note:** Blacklisting is generally less reliable than whitelisting because it's difficult to anticipate all possible attack vectors.
    *   **Data Type Validation:**  Ensure that input is of the expected data type (e.g., an integer for an ID).

*   **Least Privilege:**  Grant database users only the minimum necessary privileges.  If a web application only needs to read data from a few tables, don't grant it full database access.
*   **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):**  WAFs can inspect HTTP traffic and block malicious requests, including those that attempt SQL injection.  They act as a filter between the user and the web application.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly review your code and infrastructure for vulnerabilities.  Hire security professionals to conduct penetration tests to simulate real-world attacks.
*   **Escaping:** Escaping special characters transforms them into safe representations.  For example, a single quote (') might be escaped as two single quotes ('').  However, relying solely on escaping can be error-prone. Parameterized queries are preferred.
*   **Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):** ORMs can help you write database queries in a more abstract way, which can reduce the risk of SQL injection.  However, it's still important to understand how the ORM handles user input and to use it securely.

**In summary, SQL injection is a serious security vulnerability that can have devastating consequences.  Using parameterized queries and employing strong input validation are crucial for protecting your applications from this type of attack.**
